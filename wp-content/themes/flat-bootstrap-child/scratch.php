***The Process
<p class="process1"><strong>Free Consultation</strong> In most cases, Mr. Kousouros will provide you with a free consultation during which he will assess your situation. First, he will determine if you need a lawyer, and then he will determine if he is the right one for you. Then he will spend time reviewing your case and discussing it with you. These conversations will be substantive ones, not sales pitches. He will ask you to bring your paperwork with you to the meeting or send it to him in advance.  If the case is electronically filed he will review it prior to meeting with you.</p> 
<p><strong>What you can expect</strong> An honest and direct appraisal of your criminal case. You will hear what you need to hear in order to make an informed decision that is rooted in the realities of your case. You will not hear promises nor receive any guarantees of particular outcomes— no lawyer can or should provide such assurances. You will hear the truth.</p>
<p class="process1"><strong>Pre-Arrest</strong> In those cases where the client is under investigation and has not been arrested, Mr. Kousouros will contact authorities to ensure that his client is not questioned unless he is at his client’s side. He will review the facts with the client and often commence his own investigation in order to gather evidence to assist in his efforts to prevent an arrest— an outcome he has often achieved. If an arrest is unavoidable, Mr. Kousouros will exercise his best efforts to arrange for a voluntary surrender and spare his client the indignity of a public arrest.</p> 
<p><strong>What you can expect</strong> The benefit of his long and mutually respectful relationships with both law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies. This is not a time to be antagonistic – it is a time to respectfully discuss a client’s situation with the authorities and to do everything possible to ensure they will be willing to listen.</p> 
<p class="process1"><strong>Investigation</strong> Mr. Kousouros will immediately conduct meetings with his client in order to get a full and complete account of who his client is and the circumstances surrounding the criminal charges. Every case involves these two components—the case and the person. If it turns out that the case is too strong, mitigation is often found in the person.</p> 
<p><strong>What you can expect</strong> Mr. Kousouros will take all necessary steps and precautions to ensure that evidence is preserved, leads are investigated, witnesses are located and interviewed, and all evidence is examined. He will also visit the scene – a step that is critical to an effective defense. These efforts will allow him to identify both the strengths and the weaknesses in the prosecution’s case—a task indispensable to pre-trial hearings, trial preparation and plea negotiations.</p> 
<p class="process1"><strong>Negotiations</strong> The results of Mr. Kousouros’ thorough investigation, together with his expertise in the law and mastery of the criminal process, combine to place him in a very strong position during plea negotiations</p>
<p><strong>What you can expect</strong> An advocate who has the respect and ear of prosecuting authorities as well as a partner who will do everything in his power to obtain the best resolution possible.</p> 
<p class="process1"><strong>Pre-trial Motions</strong> Mr. Kousouros will use his considerable experience to strategically navigate the pre-trial process in a manner that safeguards all of his client’s rights and best interests. He will assert all standard legal rights of his client in his motion papers, but he will also use his creativity and dexterity to devise novel arguments and positions where appropriate.</p> 
<p><strong>What you can expect</strong> Mr. Kousouros’ motions are, like all other areas of his practice, of the highest quality and consistently earn the praise of judges and prosecutors alike.</p> 
<p class="process1"><strong>Trial</strong> Having tried scores of cases in both state and federal courts, Mr. Kousouros has developed and mastered the most effective strategies for all aspects of trial litigation—from jury selection, opening argument, and courtroom presentation to cross examination and closing argument. <a href="http://localhost:8888/kousouros_law/profile/">(Profile).</a></p>  
<p><strong>What you can expect</strong> Complete confidence that you have received what you deserve: a zealous, effective and strategic defense.</p>
